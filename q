# ðŸŽ¯ 1. Student Performance Tracker

**Module:** Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript  

---

### Task Description  

In this activity, you are to design a simple **Student Performance Tracker** that teachers can use to manage classroom records directly from their browser. The goal is to create a webpage where a teacher can add student details, view all students at a glance, and easily identify those who are performing well or need support.  

Your web page should include a form that allows the teacher to enter each studentâ€™s name, age, class, image URL, and the scores of three subjects. When a student is added, their information should appear in a table on the same page. Each row in the table should display the studentâ€™s profile picture, name, class, average score, and a performance category based on the average: **Excellent** for averages of 75 and above, **Good** for scores between 50 and 74, and **Needs Help** for any score below 50. The categories should be color-codedâ€”green for excellent, yellow for good, and red for needs helpâ€”to make it easy to interpret at a glance.  

In addition to displaying the records, the tracker should include a **search feature** that filters students by name as the teacher types. There should also be a **delete option** to remove any student from the list. To make the tracker more practical, the data should be saved in the browser using **localStorage**, so that all student records remain available even after refreshing the page.  

You are expected to build this project using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Structure your files neatly in a folder named `student-tracker`, containing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Use any online image URLs for the student pictures, keeping them around **50Ã—50 pixels** in size. Once your files are ready, open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and test your work.  

Finally, test your tracker by adding at least five students, trying out the search function, deleting one record, and refreshing the page to confirm that the data is still available.
